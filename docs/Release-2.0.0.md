# Release 2.0.0

## Changes

### Building, configuration and examples

- The native iOS SDK source is now included in the RNBranch project and is no longer a required external dependency.
- A jar file is included for the Android SDK.
- A Branch-SDK podspec is included in the NPM module for use in native apps that use the React pod from node_modules.
- Five new example apps are available:
  + testbed_simple illustrates the simplest way to integrate the SDK using `react-native link`.
  + testbed_native_ios illustrates including `react-native-branch` in a React Native component within a native iOS app.
  + testbed_native_android illustrates including `react-native-branch` in a React Native component within a native Android app.
  + webview_example is a realistic example of SDK integration following best practices.
  + webview_example_native_ios is a realistic example of SDK integration in a React Native component within a Swift app.
- An optional `branch.json` file may be added to an app to control certain Branch configuration
  parameters. If presetnt, it is automatically integrated when using `react-native link`.

### JS API changes

- Added missing `AddToCartEvent`, which was listed in the docs but not present in the SDK.
- Disabled `setDebug()`, which has never worked and is unsupportable. See https://rnbranch.app.link/hGj7E61EhD
  for details.
- Removed the filter in the native layers that was passing null `params` to the `branch.subscribe` callback.
  Now `params` will never be null in the callback. Non-Branch links are
  available using the `+non_branch_link` parameter, like the rest of Branch's SDKs. See in particular the
  webview_example for updated usage. The `uri` parameter still exists, and its behavior is largely unchanged, but
  it should now be considered deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

### iOS API changes

An `RNBranchLinkOpenedNotification` was added to allow link routing in native apps that integrate `react-native-branch`.
See testbed_native_ios and webview_example_native_ios for examples.

The `[RNBranch handleDeepLink:]` method is deprecated. Instead, please use the relevant methods on
the `RNBranch.branch` singleton: `[RNBranch.branch application:openURL:sourceApplication:annotation:]` or `[RNBranch.branch application:openURL:options:]`, depending which method you are using in your `AppDelegate`.

_Objective-C_
```Obj-C
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)app openURL:(NSURL *)url options:(NSDictionary<UIApplicationOpenURLOptionsKey,id> *)options
{
  return [RNBranch.branch application:app openURL:url options:options];
}
```

_Swift_
```Swift
func application(_ app: UIApplication, open url: URL, options: [UIApplicationOpenURLOptionsKey : Any] = [:]) -> Bool {
    return RNBranch.branch.application(app, open: url, options: options)
}
```

**OR**

_Objective-C_
```Obj-C
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application openURL:(NSURL *)url sourceApplication:(NSString *)sourceApplication annotation:(id)annotation {
    return [RNBranch.branch application:application openURL:url sourceApplication:sourceApplication annotation:annotation];
}
```

_Swift_
```Swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, open url: URL, sourceApplication: String?, annotation: Any) -> Bool {
    return RNBranch.branch.application(application, open: url, sourceApplication: sourceApplication, annotation: annotation)
}
```

Note that the second method in UIApplicationDelegate is deprecated as of iOS 9 and should be
replaced with the first if possible. If you don't have either of these methods in your app yet,
use the first one: `[AppDelegate application:openURL:options:]`. The examples above assume
only Branch integration. Your implementation may look different if you have integrated other
linking SDKs such as Linking or Facebook.

### Android API changes

An overload of `Branch.initSession` was introduced that accepts a `Branch.BranchUniversalReferralInitListener` to allow link routing in native apps that integrate `react-native-branch`. An `RNBranchModule.NATIVE_INIT_SESSION_FINISHED_EVENT` local broadcast is also available for the same purpose. See testbed_native_android for an example.

As of 2.0.0-beta.8, two distinct flavors of the SDK are available to support different versions
of RN: `latest` for RN >= 0.47 and `legacy` for RN >= 0.40, < 0.47. This requires a change to the app's
build.gradle (TODO: automation).

## SDK Integration

### Initial installation

#### Simple (iOS or Android)

```bash
npm install --save react-native-branch@2.0.0-beta.7
react-native link react-native-branch
```

Then follow the [setup instructions](./setup.md).

There's no need for CocoaPods or Carthage (iOS). The testbed_simple and
webview_example apps were built this way.

##### Android

Replace `compile project(':react-native-branch')` in the app's build.gradle
with the following two lines:

```gradle
debugCompile project(path: ':react-native-branch', configuration: 'latestDebug')
releaseCompile project(path: ':react-native-branch', configuration: 'latestRelease')
```

Substitute `legacy` for `latest` in both lines if using RN < 0.47. (TODO: Automation.)

#### In a native iOS app using the React pod

Add both the `react-native-branch` and `Branch-SDK` pods to your Podfile like this:
```Ruby
pod "React", path: "../node_modules/react-native"
# The following line is necessary with use_frameworks! or RN >= 0.42.
pod "Yoga", path: "../node_modules/react-native/ReactCommon/yoga"
pod "react-native-branch", path: "../node_modules/react-native-branch"
pod "Branch-SDK", path: "../node_modules/react-native-branch/ios"
```
Run `pod install`. Then follow the [setup instructions](./setup.md).

Note that the location of node_modules relative to your Podfile may vary. The example above assumes the iOS app is under the ios subdirectory.

The testbed_native_ios and webview_example_native_ios apps were built this way.

### Existing apps updating to 2.0

#### Update your app/build.gradle (Android)

The Branch SDK is now included as a jar file in the NPM module. Open the `android/app/build.gradle` file
in your project. Remove:

```gradle
compile 'io.branch.sdk.android:library:2.+'
```

And add this line if not already present:

```gradle
compile fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])
```

If you're using 2.0.0-beta.8 or later, replace `compile project(':react-native-branch')`
with the following two lines:

```gradle
debugCompile project(path: ':react-native-branch', configuration: 'latestDebug')
releaseCompile project(path: ':react-native-branch', configuration: 'latestRelease')
```

The `latest` flavor is for RN >= 0.47. If using RN < 0.47 (>= 0.40), substitute 'legacy'
for `latest`, i.e.:

```gradle
debugCompile project(path: ':react-native-branch', configuration: 'legacyDebug')
releaseCompile project(path: ':react-native-branch', configuration: 'legacyRelease')
```

The result should be something like
```gradle
dependencies {
    debugCompile project(path: ':react-native-branch', configuration: 'latestDebug')
    releaseCompile project(path: ':react-native-branch', configuration: 'latestRelease')
    compile fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])
    compile "com.android.support:appcompat-v7:23.0.1"
    compile "com.facebook.react:react-native:+"  // From node_modules
}
```

#### Remove the Branch SDK from your project (iOS)

##### CocoaPods

###### Apps built using react-native link

Remove "Branch" from your Podfile. Run `pod install` after updating the Podfile. This is
necessary to regenerate the Pods project without the Branch pod.

If you added CocoaPods to your project just for the Branch pod, you can remove CocoaPods entirely from your app using the [pod deintegrate](https://guides.cocoapods.org/terminal/commands.html#pod_deintegrate) command.

###### Using the React pod

Replace `pod "Branch"` in your Podfile with `pod "Branch-SDK", path: "../node_modules/react-native-branch/ios"`.
```Ruby
pod "React", path: "../node_modules/react-native"
# The following line is necessary with use_frameworks! or RN >= 0.42.
pod "Yoga", path: "../node_modules/react-native/ReactCommon/yoga"
pod "react-native-branch", path: "../node_modules/react-native-branch"
pod "Branch-SDK", path: "../node_modules/react-native-branch/ios"
```

Run `pod install` after making this change.

##### Carthage

Remove Branch.framework from your app's dependencies. Also remove Branch.framework from your `carthage copy-frameworks` build phase.

##### Manually installed

Remove Branch.framework from your app's dependencies.
